=================================

A Genetic Algorithm Application that Simulates Biological Evolution

Little Feeders is a program that attempts to simulate a very simple natural environment. In this environment are feeders and food. Each feeder is given a set of traits - eyesight strength, speed, and intelligence level. Each of these traits is given a number value that indicates the strength of that trait. The feeders use these traits to find and eat food (note also that food objects are stationary). At the end of each generation, each feeder is given a fitness score based on the amount of food it has eaten. The feeders that eat the most (and thus have the highest fitness scores) are most likely to mate and pass on their traits to the next generation.
